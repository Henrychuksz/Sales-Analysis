# Sales-Analysis
### Project description
This goal of this is to analyze the entire sales of a company for a complete year given sales data from the company. The analysis tends to answer some critical company questions such as
1. What was the best month for sales and how much money was made in that month
2. What city had the highest number of sales 
3. What time of each day should the company display ads to maximize the the likelihood of customers buying products
4. What products are most often sold together
5. What product sold the most and what could be the reason for it
6. What is the average sales amount made in each sales day for the entire month

### Code
The project obviously contains some feature engineering where necessary for each question to be answered for example creating a column for Months, time in Hours and city etc.
